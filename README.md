Today I learned

Inspired by [@jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and
[@thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), this repository holds
small writeups of things I learn. This is first and foremost a mneumonic
device for me: I don't strive to present genuinely new information, so don't
be surprised if you get some "well, duh" moments reading these writeups.
