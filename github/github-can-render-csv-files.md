# Github can render CSV files

Today I learned that Github can render CSV files nicely. In other words,
if you have tabular data that you want to showcase on a repo, don't
bother formatting it nicely in HTML and embedding it in markdown:
The CSV file will render nicely on Github all by itself.

[See this example for what I mean](example.csv)
