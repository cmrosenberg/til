# Github can render CSV and TSV files

Today I learned that Github can render
[CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) and
[TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) files nicely.
In other words, if you have tabular data that you want to showcase on
a repo, don't bother formatting it nicely in HTML and embedding it in
markdown: A CSV or TSV file will render nicely on Github all by itself.

[Example CSV](example.csv)
[Example TSV](example.tsv)
